# The Gift of Time

First Parish Church of Stow and Acton, MA, March 2020

### Opening Words and Chalice Lighting

Look to this day!  
For it is life, the very life of life.  
In its brief course lie all the verities  
And realities of your existence:  
The bliss of growth,  
The glory of action,  
The splendor of beauty;  
For yesterday is but a dream,  
And tomorrow is only a vision;  
But today, well lived, makes every yesterday  
     A dream of happiness  
     And every tomorrow a vision of hope..  
     Look well, therefore, to this day.  
― Attributed to Kalidasa

### Check-in/Sharing  
This is the time to mention briefly any major issues or events on your mind that you would like to share. Ask the group to agree to the Covenant and read the “Deep Listening” poem together.

### Topic: The Gift of Time

Time is one of life's greatest gifts. Sometimes time appears to move quickly and we can barely keep up, while sometimes time drags and challenges our patience. We can view time as something to be mastered, or as a friend, giving us chances for reflection, healing and growth. Throughout our lives, we evolve how we balance reviewing the past, thinking about the future and living in the present moment. We put great emphasis on the importance of time and how we spend it. What is a good use of time and what is a waste of time? The answer to this question is unique to every individual. Let’s explore what time means to each of us, how we use it, and how, if at all, we would like to change the ways we spend our time.

“Time is free, but it’s priceless. You can’t own it, but you can use it. You can’t keep it, but you can spend it. Once you’ve lost it you can never get it back.” - _Harvey Mackay_
 
“Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you.” - _Carl Sandburg_
 
“We ask for long life, but ’tis deep life, or grand moments that signify. Let the measure of time be spiritual, not mechanical.” - _Ralph Waldo Emerson_

“Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under the trees on a summer’s day, listening to the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time.”  - _Sir J. Lubbock_

“Doing nothing is better than being busy doing nothing.” - _Lao Tzu_

“I still find the day too short for all the thoughts I want to think, all the walks I want to take, all the books I want to read, and all the friends I want to see.”  - _John Burroughs_

“There’s never enough time to do all the nothing you want.” - _Bill Watterson_

### Possible Questions for Discussion:
 * Could you describe times when you felt that you did not have enough time or times when you felt that you had too much time?  
 * Think about how you spend your time. Could you imagine ways to incorporate people or activities more important to you or reduce less important activities? Could you share any strategies that have worked for you?
 * How do you feel when you are “doing nothing” or when you are not “busy”? What does “down time” mean to you?  
 * When do you procrastinate? Are there times you plan ahead? How do you balance planning with spontaneity? How do you balance living in the past or future with living in the present?
 * Could you share any “timeless” moments or “quality” time that has meant a lot to you?

(Group will take a few minutes to consider topic and questions and then share).

### Closing Words

“Yesterday’s the past, tomorrow’s the future, but today is a gift. That’s why it’s called the present.” - _Bil Keane_
