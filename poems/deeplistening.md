Deep Listening  Mary-Elizabeth Cotton  
Let us listen…  
  
   Just for a while  
   let us silence our minds  
   and open our hearts.  
  
      Just for a while  
      let us listen from within.  
  
Listen…  
Not to gain knowledge,  
not to formulate questions,  
  
rather to chance upon  
sacred bonds and  
profound wisdom.  
  
Just for a while  
let us not seek information  
or answers.  
  
Let us not rouse the intellect  
but embrace the sprit.  
  
If thoughts cloud the brain  
may we let them pass.  
  
If replies tingle on the tongue,  
let us breathe them away silently.  
  
Return to them later  
but here…  
  
Here in this precious time of sharing  
Let us listen…  
  
Let the words wash over us  
and seep into a still quiet pool.  
  
Let us listen.
